This tablet is really great for its price (~$85 USD), it comes with a Helio P60T and 3GB of RAM. Normally, tablets at this price range come with at best a Helio A22 or as bad as a UniSoc T310.
The one downside is that since it's not a common tablet, there aren't easily available existing root options. Luckily, you are here!
